Sed is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or
input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted  edits  (such  as  ed),  sed
works  by  making  only  one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to
filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
