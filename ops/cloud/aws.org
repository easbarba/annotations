* Commands
** configure
* AMI
* EC2
* EBS
* ELB
* NLB
* S3
* Storage
** EBS
- survive shutdowns and system crashes
- can be encrypted
- can be moved around, mounted on other instances
** EC2
- ephemeral data
- no encryption
- lack of flexibility

*** Instances
**** Reserved Instances
to run uninterrupted for more than a month at a time, then you’ll usually be
better off purchasing a reserved instance.

- All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront

**** On-Demand Instances
for workloads that need to run for a limited time without interrup- tion. You
could, for instance, schedule an on-demand instance in anticipation of increased
requests against your application

**** Spot Instances
As instâncias spot do Amazon EC2 permitem aproveitar a capacidade não utilizada do EC2 na Nuvem AWS.''

**** Amazon Lightsail
is an easy-to-use virtual private server (VPS) that offers simple management of
cloud resources such as containers, at low, predictable prices.
**** AWS Elastic Beanstalk
is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and
services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker
on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

- don’t choose resources
- generates costs according to how resources are consumed
* Marketplace
* Console
* Containers
** Amazon Elastic Container Service
** Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes
** AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code
for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or
managing servers.

- run only when triggered by a preset event

* SAM
** serverless
