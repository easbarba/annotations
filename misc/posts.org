* Shell scripting with GNU getopt
Shell scripts are usually dead simple to use, you just run it and is done.

Sometimes you will need something more flexible that require user's input,

The GNU's getopt, not to confuse with bash's builtin getopt, has some niceties.

One such a cool feature is the long options found in most cli apps that improve clarity to the end-user.

Of course, if you dont want to anyone user as much a '-a, --alternative' is avaiable that lets use to use long option providing only one hiphen:

#+begin_src shell
./script -yell foo # FOO
#+end_src

An example can be found in '/usr/share/doc/util-linux/examples/'
