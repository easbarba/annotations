Domain Name Service


* definition
#+begin_quote
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system
used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the
Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The resource records
contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information.
These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical
IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying
network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other
functions as well.
