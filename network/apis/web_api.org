* Goals
- Whos: Where you list the API’s users (or profles)
- Whats: Where you list what these users can do
- Hows: Where you decompose each of the what’s into steps
- Inputs (source): Where you list what is needed for each step and where it comes from (to spot missing whos, whats, or hows)
- Output (usage): Where you list what is returned by each step and how it is used (to spot missing whos, whats, or hows)
- Goals: Where you explicitly and concisely reformulate each how + inputs + outputs
