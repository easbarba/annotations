* GraphQL
- is a specification
- represent data in a graph
- graph database is a collection of nodes and edges.
- types, queries, and mutations are defined in the schema
- flexible in defining the structure of the data that's returned when making a query against the API.
- Subscriptions open the door to asynchronous messaging.
- Query and mutation data exchange are synchronous due to the request-response pattern inherent in the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
- Synchronous and asynchronous activities are distinct.
- 2 servers: synchronous HTTP server and also an asynchronous subscription server.
-  While the specification allows for customization, the basic framework cannot be avoided.
