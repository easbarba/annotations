* Load balancing
* Layers
** Layer 1:
- physical link light, ipconfig/ifconfig, cable replacement
** Layer 2: Datalink
The datalink layer transforms the network’s upper layers into the signals transmitted over
the wire.

- ethernet
-  datalink arp, ND, tcpdump

*** troubleshooting
- tcpdump
- arp

** Layer 3: Network
maps connectivity between hosts

- packet
- network ping, traceroute

*** troubleshooting
- ping
- traceroute

** Layer 4: Transport
The data you care about flows at the transport layer. The lower layers of the stack exist to
support the transport layer. A piece of transport layer data is a segment.

- Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- transport netstat, netcat, tcpdump

*** troubleshooting
- netstat
** session layer
 handles opening, using, and closing transport layer connections.

- logs, debuggers

** presentation layer
  lets programs exchange data with one another,
- logs, debuggers
** application layer
is the actual protocol spoken over these connections.

- logs, debuggers
* Ports
** Well-known Ports
also known as system ports

- 0 and 1023
** Registered Ports
** Dynamic Ports

* Subneting
* OSI Model
** Concepts
- 7 layers
- works for almost every type of network, even extremely old and long-obsolete ones
** Layers
*** Layer 7 Application
*** Layer 6 Presentation
*** Layer 5 Session
*** Layer 4 Transport
*** Layer 3 Network
*** Layer 2 Data Link
- Data Link layer
- Switches handle traffic using MAC addresses
- NIC is in the Data Link layer and the Physical layer
*** Layer 1 Physical
- defines the method of moving data between computers
- cabling and central box are part of the Physical layer
- doesn’t care what data goes through
- it just moves the data from one system to another system
- NIC interface between the PC and the network

* Terms
** Mac Address
An Ethernet unique identifier.

- three groups of four hexadecimal characters each, separated by periods.
- first six numbers of the MAC address identifies the Ethernet card manufacturer.

#+begin_src conf

#+end_src
** Duplex
how each end handles transmitting and receiving data
* LAN
- IP address
- Ethernet MAC Adress
* Physical
** Cable
*** UTP
- unshielded twisted pair
- contains four pairs of wires
*** central box
* Terms
  - hotspot
  - VOIP
  - IPTV
  - RFID
  - 2 family (p2p)
  - desktop sharing
** Mac Adress
** OSI layers
** TCP/IP
** NIC
** FCS
** PANs
Personal Area Networks let devices communicate over the range of a person.

- Bluetooth
** LAN
A Local Area Network is a private network that operates within and nearby
a single building such as a home, office, or factory.

- Access Point: AP
- IEEE 802.11: WIFI
- IEEE 802.3: Ethernet
- switch
- VLAN
** MAN
Metropolitan Area Networks
** Subnet Mask
A subnet mask is a number that distinguishes the network address and the host
address within an IP address.

11111111111111111111111100000000
** Mac adress
- uses Address Resolution Protocol to figure out the MAC address based on the destination IP address
* hostname
** def
A hostname is a label assigned to a device (a host) on a network. It
distinguishes one device from another on a specific network or over the
internet. The hostname for a computer on a home network may be something like
new laptop, Guest-Desktop, or FamilyPC.
* URL
Uniform Resource Locator
** def
Abbreviated as URL, a Uniform Resource Locator is a way of identifying the
location of a file on the internet. They're what we use to open not only
websites, but also to download images, videos, software programs, and other
types of files that are hosted on a server.
