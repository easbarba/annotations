***** blockquote
The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source.
***** address
The address element represents the contact information for its nearest article
or body element ancestor. If that is the body element, then the contact
information applies to the document as a whole.
**** sectioning
***** section
The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A
section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a
heading.
***** main
The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that
document and excludes content that is repeated across a set of documents such as
site navigation links, copyright information, site logos and banners and search
forms (unless the document or application's main function is that of a search form).

- A document must not have more than one main element that does not have the hidden attribute specified.

***** article
The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a
document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently
distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.
***** nav
The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to
parts within the page: a section with navigation links.
***** header
The header element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
***** aside
The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that
is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could
be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as
sidebars in printed typography.
***** footer
The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning
content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information
about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright
data, and the like.
** Void elements
- referred to as void elements because they have no contents.
- area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track, wbr
