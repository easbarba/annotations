#+TITLE: Apache

* Virtual hosts

* DirectoryIndex
With the default DirectoryIndex settings on Apache, a file named index.html will
always take precedence over an index.php file. This is useful for setting up
maintenance pages in PHP applications, by creating a temporary index.html file
containing an informative message to visitors. Because this page will take
precedence over the index.php page, it will then become the landing page for the
application. Once maintenance is over, the index.html is renamed or removed from
the document root, bringing back the regular application page.

In case you want to change this behavior, youâ€™ll need to edit the
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf file and modify the order in which the
index.php file is listed within the DirectoryIndex directive:

#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
#+end_src
