#+title:  Unix Domain Sockets

* Concept
- Unix sockets don’t actually write the data they send to the disk
- all the data is retained within kernel memory
- a socket file is to maintain a reference to the socket, and to give it filesystem permissions to control acces
- a socket file doesn’t contain anything, and you shouldn’t modify it directly, except for the permissions where applicable
- TCP-based sockets are called stream sockets, where all data will arrive in order.
- UDP-based sockets are datagram sockets, where order (or even delivery) isn’t guaranteed.
- raw sockets don’t have any restrictions
- alternative to network-based TCP connections when processes are running on the same machine.
* Stream sockets
- uses the SOCK_STREAM protocol
